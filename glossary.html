<dd><p>An <strong>Identifier</strong> is a character string that is being used for identification purposes (by a specific <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a>).[^1] This includes names and labels, as they are (obviously) used for such purposes.</p>
<p>Note that while an identifier is used for identification purposes, <u>this does not automatically imply that it actually identifies (singles out) anything</u>.

<dd><p><strong>Identity</strong> is a term that is heavily debated.

Generalizing this idea, we say that the identity of any <a href="#entity">entity</a> consists of the combined <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a> (that is: of all <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> that know) about this entity.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf">Pfitzmann and Hansen (2010)</a>, we define a <a href="#partial-identity">partial identity</a> (of an <a href="#entity">entity</a>) as all the <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a> that a single, specific <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> has about that entity (= the 'subject' of the <a href="#partial-identity">partial identity</a>).

<dd><p>A <strong>Risk</strong> is the effects that uncertainty can have on the intended realization of an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> of a <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> (which we call the <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">risk owner</a>). Uncertainty is a lack of information, understanding or <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a> of events, their consequences or likelihoods, and this may affect the results that a party expects and intends to realize so as to fulfull its objectives.</p>
<p>While traditionally these effects are assumed to be negative (i.e. damaging, harmful) to this party, they may also be positive. For example, if you buy a ticket in a lottery, you (should) expect to lose money (the prize of the ticket). However, there is this uncertainty, this lack of information, the effect of it would be that this intended/expected result is deviated from, and you actually win a prize. If this risk is unacceptable (e.g. if you do not know how to manage large amounts of money), then that would call the risk to be <a href="#risk-management" title="Risk management is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific party for the purpose of managing the risks that it owns.">managed</a>.</p>
<p>Risk is about the <em>possible</em> effects that uncertainty may have on the intended/expected realization of an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> of some <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a>. In this sense, at least in theory, this means that 'risk' is an objective notion because different parties may have the same ideas about what such effects on a given <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> could be. However, since an  <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> is owned by precisely one <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a>, and therefore only that party actually knows the actual meaning of that objective, in practice there is little point in drafting lists of such possible effects to make risk assessments easier.</p>
<p>An <em>acceptable risk</em> is a set of such effects that the <a href="#risk-owner">risk owner</a> has decided that it can, and is willing to deal with as they materialize. They need no further attention.

<dd><p><strong>Risk management</strong> is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> for the purpose of managing the <a href="#risk" title="A Risk is the effects that uncertainty can have on the intended realization of an objective of a party (which we call the risk owner).">risks</a> that it <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">owns</a>. We distinguish between various kinds of risk-management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>centralized risk-management</strong>, which is a kind of risk management that assumes that the <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> that runs it has the power or right to give orders, make decisions that other parties must follow, and enforce obedience, which can be applied to mitigate its risks. This kind of risk-management ignores the natural autonomy of other <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a>.</li>
<li><strong>decentralized or networked risk-management</strong>, which is a kind of risk management that assumes that the <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> that runs it acknowledges the autonomy of other <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> to make their own (risk-related) decisions, and therefore starts and maintains relations with such parties that help them both to manage their individual, subjective risks.</li>

<dd><p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to <a href="#concept">concepts/ideas</a>, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> as they negotiate and execute electronic <a href="#transaction">transactions</a> with one another.</p>
<p>The dialogue about what Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) really is — started in the blog &quot;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>&quot; by Christopher Allen in 2016 — has not resulted in a consensus today. While some see the ten principles of SSI that Allen proposed as the definition of SSI, he formulated them as &quot;a departure point to provoke a discussion about what's truly important&quot;. And it is obvious that what is important differs per <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a>.</p>
<p>The perspective that the eSSIF-Lab framework takes is that of supporting (autonomous) <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> as they negotiate and execute electronic <a href="#transaction">(business) transactions</a> with one another. So anything that helps - e.g. concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies, will be covered by that term.</p>

<dd><!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the semantics to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
<p>We use the term <strong>semantics</strong> to refer to the mapping between (tangible) <a href="#term">terms</a> and (intangible) <a href="#concept">concepts</a> (their meaning, the ideas behind it). Semantics are scoped, i.e. every <a href="#scope">scope</a> has its own semantic mapping. This implies that every <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> has - and maintains - its own (subjective) semantics, which is its subjective mapping of a set of terms onto the concepts/ideas in its <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a>. The (erroneous) assumption that <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> would (automagically) share a semantics is the cause of many misunderstandings, and hence should be identified and deleted as soon as possible.</p>

<li>run a yellow pages service which <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> can use to find out which members (or other parties) issue credentials of a certain type.</li>
<li>govern and document accreditation schemes, including schemes for accrediting parties that may certify others against such schemes.</li>
<li>act as a <a href="#governor">governing party</a> for decision trees (<strong>to be elaborated on</strong>)</li>
